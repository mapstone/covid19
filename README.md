# Humidity Relationship
Curious how COVID19 is going to behave this summer? We thought this would be fun to explore. We found that ⬆️ humidity correlates to ⬆️ in covid19. Opposite of what news cycle says. We found no temp trend. Could be confounded by Europe.

Interestingly, if you only look at aggregate data (average humidity vs growth rate) this trend dissapears. However, in this chart we take into acount the actual humidity on the given day when we believe people got infected! Perhaps countires are confounding this correlation, but perhaps the "first take" by the media has the relationship backwards. Related viruses are seasonal and are less contagious in humid weather, so this is a concerning correlation. We will update this chart as more countries have significant growth rates 

Update: 19/March. Indonesia, where it is very humid, seems to have a high growth rate!

# Australia Example

Corona virus has had exponential growth in most countries. We are particularly interested in Australia because Australia in January is similar to many northern countries in the summer.
